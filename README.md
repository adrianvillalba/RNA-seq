# RNA-seq
This is the workflow i use to process RNA-seq data and perform differential gene expression analysis. 
The RNA-seq workflow file is the consecution of one-line single commands used in UNIX environments to perform Quality Check, Mapping, Alignement and Counting of reads for the whole genome or for specific chromosomes. 


After that, to perform statistical analysis of differential gene expression I uploaded the file DESeq2_workflow that contains the R code to found altered genes. Furthermore, gene enrichment analysis to find altered pathways could be perform within the same script, coded in R as well. 


Suggestions are welcome.
